# 🛟 Support Guide – Nexus Core

> **Clarity. Transparency. Zero noise.**

---

## 🧭 Navigation & Usage

### How does this portal work?
Nexus Core is a **static, client-side dashboard** that organizes official CafePersians links into human-readable cards.  
When you click a card, your browser opens the destination in a **new tab** — just like clicking any bookmark.

### Why are some links not loading?
A small number of **external services** (e.g., `ok-ex.io`, `techforall1373.github.io/cafepersians.io.lib/`) may display a security page due to **their own server-side protections**.  
This is **not caused by Nexus Core** — it reflects the current accessibility status of those third-party domains.

> 🔍 **Tip**: If a link shows a security page, try accessing it directly in a new browser window or incognito mode.

## 🛠️ Self-Help Solutions

| Issue | Recommended Action |
|------|---------------------|
| **Page layout broken** | Disable ad-blockers or privacy extensions temporarily |
| **Search not filtering** | Type part of the **display name** (e.g., “Nobitex”, “Support”, “Payment”) |
| **Link opens blank tab** | The target site may be temporarily down — check back later |
| **Mobile UI misaligned** | Rotate to landscape or update your browser |

## 📥 How to Report an Issue

We welcome feedback — but please help us triage effectively.

### ✅ Report if:
- A **CafePersians-owned link** (e.g., `takl.ink/...`, `techforall1373.github.io/...`) is permanently unreachable
- The **dashboard UI** behaves incorrectly (e.g., search fails, cards unclickable)
- You find a **typo in a display name**

### ❌ Do not report if:
- An **external exchange or third-party site** shows a security page
- A referral link has expired (these are managed by external platforms)

### 📬 Contact Methods
- **Preferred**: [Open a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/techforall1373/nexus-core-stealth-links/issues)
- **Email**: `support@cafepersians.io`  
  → Include: browser, device, link name, and screenshot (if possible)

> ⏳ We aim to respond within **3 business days**.
